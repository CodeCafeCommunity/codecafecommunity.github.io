Whether you're a beginner looking to learn alongside me or an experienced dev wanting to sharpen your skills, you're welcome to join the journey. I'll be working through the C# learning path on Exercism, working through challenges live. Once I complete it, the community will get to vote on the next language I take on!\n\nCome hang out, ask questions, and level up your coding skills together!"
