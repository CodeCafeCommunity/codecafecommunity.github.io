## Code Checks Before Committing

We use Husky and lint-staged to check your staged files.

When you commit, Husky triggers lint-staged, which runs tools like ESLint and Prettier on changed files.

If any issues are found, the commit is blocked until theyâ€™re fixed. Check your terminal output for linting or formatting errors.

Once everything passes, you can commit successfully!
